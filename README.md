# This repo showcases the actual work that is done by React under the hood.

Basically what React does is simplify the process of DOM Manipulation and let the user define the structure using normal HTML syntax, as opposed to using the DOM API in vanilla JS.

I have built a simple to-do app using 2 methods:

First using vanilla JS in [index.js](index.js),

and the second as an SPA using React.
